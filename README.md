Chlarity is a blockchain-based platform that redefines the landscape of charitable giving by introducing transparency and accountability. Our mission is to revolutionize the donation process and provide a reliable mechanism for monitoring charitable organizations.

## How Chlarity Works

1. **Request Submission by Hospitals:**
   - Hospitals register on the Chlarity portal and submit requests on behalf of patients.

2. **NGO Scrutiny and Approval:**
   - The NGO reviews and scrutinizes the requests from hospitals.
   - Upon approval, a smart contract is deployed for the specific request.

3. **Treatment and Fund Disbursement:**
   - If the patient's treatment is successfully completed, the NGO admin can initiate funds.
   - Funds are transferred to the hospital's address.

4. **Security Measures:**
   - In case of any issues such as the hospital failing to deliver the promised treatment or suspicious activities, the smart contract can be destroyed.

5. **Refund Mechanism:**
   - If needed, funds can be returned to the main contract from the request contract.
   - The main contract ensures that funds are distributed only through approved requests.

6. **Fund Management:**
   - The main contract holds the donated funds from donors.
   - Funds can only be transferred to contracts that are created at the time of request approval.
